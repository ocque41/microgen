# Home Hero Refresh — Execution Ledger

| Status | Task | Owner Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | Ensure ProgressiveBlur layer renders beneath navbar while keeping sticky behavior. | Z-index lowered to sit under nav capsule. |
| ✅ | Re-measure hero divider spacing so gaps above/below match exactly and typography ratios meet new spec. | Divider weight/spacing recalibrated via shared CSS variable. |
| ✅ | Replace shader card with rotating orange/blue imagery, applying synchronized blur + logo motion. | New rotator swaps assets every 5s with fade + logo artifact. |
| ✅ | Promote brand assets: logo (4) in navbar/footer, logo (5) + logo (4) favicons, and mirror MICROAGENTS wordmark in footer. | Assets copied to `public/`, nav/footer + favicons updated. |
| ✅ | Final regression: run `npm run build` and capture output. | Build succeeded (see logs in CLI). |
