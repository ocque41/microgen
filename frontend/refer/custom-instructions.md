### Logo & Animation Guidelines

1. Remove the logo from its current position.
2. Eliminate any backlighting or glow effects behind the logo.
3. Merge the animation with the logo by placing an oversized version of the logo behind the animation layer.
4. Add shaders or blending effects so the background logo integrates smoothly and organically with the animation.
