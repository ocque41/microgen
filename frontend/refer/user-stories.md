1. user signs in 
2. user starts talking to the chatkit agent 
3. agent recommends microagents that can perform daily task for the use case of the user as the user walks the agent through his use case 
4. micro agents get decided 
5. needed data for workflow to run is putted
6. workflow is tested
7. ran successful
8. user accepts microagent 
9. stripe billing opens with the agent monthly/yearly plan
10. user pays successfully 
11. user gets redirected to the dashboard with an active plan and an active microagent

Personas → end-to-end user stories (mapped to your 1–13 steps)
1) Solo founder (SaaS)

Day they discover: Sees a landing hero “Spin up tiny agents that run your daily ops” + 3 template cards (Support triage, Billing follow-ups, Churn alerts). (Simple hook: “Stop doing the same 10 tasks every day.”)
Flow:
1–2. Signs in → chats with the Builder agent. (micro: create account; say what they need)
3–5. Agent proposes 3 microagents; founder picks “Billing follow-ups” → enters Stripe key + email template. (micro: add the data the agent needs)
6–7. Test run on a sandbox invoice → success report. (micro: safe dry-run)
8–11. Accepts → Stripe Checkout opens for monthly plan → pay → redirect to dashboard with agent “ON”. (micro: pay & return)
12–13. Sees traces (“emails sent”), facts (customers with unpaid invoices), can pause/tune/cancel. (micro: control room)
Why this fits: Chat-led setup + widgets, human approval before any real action, and Stripe Checkout for billing.

2) Marketing manager (e-commerce)

Discovery: TikTok/short demo showing PMax budget nudge agent catching wasted spend at 7am.
Flow highlights: picks “Ad Spend Nudge” and “Creative Ideas” agents; connects GA4/Meta tokens; test alert → approves → Team workspace (invites analyst) → pay per user (€5) + agent usage; dashboard shows daily traces and “facts: ROAS<2.5 yesterday”. (micro: alerts + ideas; team can see it)
Notes: Use Team workspace + Stripe multi-seat pricing; guardrails for tokens; @mentions to ping #ad-nudge agent in chat. 
Stripe Docs

3) Ops lead (SMB)

Discovery: Google result “microagents for repetitive back-office” → reads a 700-word guide with a 3-step diagram.
Flow highlights: selects “Slack ticket router” + “Weekly inventory check”; connects Slack + Sheets via custom MCP; human approval node before posting in production; accepts → Checkout annual; dashboard shows “agent traces” and last 20 routed tickets. (micro: try in test, then go live)
Notes: MCP read/write via custom connector; Human approval and If/Else logic node.

4) Student/solo creator

Discovery: Template gallery: “Personal research assistant”, “Podcast prep”, “Study planner”.
Flow highlights: chooses “Study planner”, provides calendar + courses; test produces a week plan; accepts → Solo FREE workspace (no teammates), pays only agent usage; dashboard facts show “hours left” + sources list; can buy more agents later. (micro: starts free, only pays for use; can add more later)
Notes: Solo FREE = unlimited agents catalog but no invites; usage metered per microagent. Stripe handles usage/tiered pricing if needed.

Entry channels → what they see, read, feel (to trigger signup)

Homepage (first-time):
See: bold hero, 3 templates, 30-sec embed demo. Read: “Describe your workflow → we propose microagents → test → approve → run 24/7.” Feel: relief (“finally offload busywork”). Primary CTA: Start free. (micro: show value in 15s)

Template Gallery:
See: cards (Support Triage, Billing Follow-ups, PMax Nudge…). Read: short outcomes + setup time (e.g., “5 mins”). Feel: clarity + speed. CTA: Configure in chat. (micro: pick a ready pattern)

Docs/Developers:
See: “Connect any API with MCP,” code stubs, security notes. Read: “Use custom MCP for write actions.” Feel: control + trust. CTA: Launch chat with dev template.

Social proof case study:
See: 3 charts (time saved, SLA, revenue). Read: “Deployed 2 agents in 1 day.” Feel: confidence. CTA: Recreate this setup. (micro: proof beats promises)

Pricing:
See: Solo FREE; Team $5/seat; Enterprise talk to sales. Read: “Pay agent usage separately,” “Cancel anytime,” “Stripe secure.” Feel: low risk. CTA: Start with FREE.

Community/Discord mental model (copy hook):
“Create Servers (projects) and Channels (agent chats). @mention multiple agents in one thread.” (Maps to Discord servers/channels; familiar UX.) 
Discord Support

Workspace model (Discord/Slack analogy) → product spec (short)

Servers = Groups per use case/project. Channels = one per microagent. Users can chat in a channel or tag agents together (multi-agent thread). (micro: like team chat, but with bots that act)

@mentions / entity tags for agents in composer; hover previews via widgets.

Dashboard: “Traces” (what happened) + “Facts” (state the agent learned) via ChatKit widgets; actions on cards to pause/tune.

Checkout: After “Accept agent,” open Stripe Checkout (monthly/yearly; add seats for Team). Redirect back with active plan flags.

Flow glue (what makes the 13 steps work technically)

Chat front-end: ChatKit embed + theme; start screen prompts; attachments disabled by default. 
OpenAI Platform

Workflow: Start → Agent → If/Else → Human approval → MCP → Transform/Set state → end. (All nodes available.)

Widgets & Actions: Cards/Lists/Buttons with onClickAction; forms send payloads; server handles actions; can stream updates.

Hosted vs self-hosted: Start simple (hosted). If you need custom logic, use ChatKit server (FastAPI/Express) and Agents SDK helpers to stream events.

Publishing: Publish your Agent Builder workflow → get WORKFLOW_ID → issue client_secret tokens for sessions; refresh as needed.

Micro-explainers (your 1–13 in plain words)

Sign in: make an account so we can save your setup.

Talk to the agent: say your goal in simple words.

Get suggestions: we propose tiny bots that fit your goal.

Choose bots: you pick which ones to keep.

Add info: keys/templates so bots can work.

Test: try it safely before going live.

See result: we show what happened.

Accept: confirm this is the bot you want.

Pay: open secure checkout (Stripe).

Payment done: card accepted.

Back to app: plan active; bot turned on.

See activity: timeline (traces) + memory (facts).

Manage: edit, pause, cancel, or add more.

Implementation guardrails (so this is “perfect”)

Add Human approval node before any write/backaction to external tools.

Add Guardrails (PII/jailbreak) on user input to keep runs safe.

Use custom MCP for any “write” integrations (Slack post, DB insert); OpenAI-built connectors are currently read-only.

Route acceptance → Stripe Checkout session; on success, set plan flags and redirect to /dashboard.
